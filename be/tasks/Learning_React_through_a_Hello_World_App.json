    "task": "Learning React through a Hello World App",
    "summary_task": "In this task, you will learn the basics of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, by creating a simple \"Hello World\" application. You will set up the development environment, create a new React project, and build a simple UI that displays \"Hello World\" on the screen.",
    "steps": [
        "Step 1: Install Node.js and npm\n\n* Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can download Node.js from the official website (<https://nodejs.org/>) and npm is included in the installation.\n\n",
        "Step 2: Install Create React App\n\n* Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Create React App, a tool for creating React projects: `npm install -g create-react-app`\n\n",
        "Step 3: Create a new React project\n\n* Create a new React project by running the following command: `create-react-app hello-world`\n* This will create a new directory called \"hello-world\" with a basic React project.\n\n",
        "Step 4: Open the project in your code editor\n\n* Open the \"hello-world\" directory in your preferred code editor.\n\n",
        "Step 5: Modify the App component\n\n* In the \"src\" directory, open the \"App.js\" file.\n* Replace the existing code with the following:\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      Hello World\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n",
        "Step 6: Run the application\n\n* In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command to start the application: `npm start`\n* The application will be available at <http://localhost:3000/>\n\n",
        "Step 7: Inspect the application\n\n* Open your web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000/>\n* You should see the text \"Hello World\" displayed on the screen.\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully created a simple React application. From here, you can continue to explore the documentation and learn more about React's powerful features."
